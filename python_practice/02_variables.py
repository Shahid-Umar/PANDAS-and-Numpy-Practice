# Use of Variables
# To perform calculations
# To import the data and name the data
# It reduce human efforts for coding
# Easy to write for long dataset
# Easy to recall

# STRATEGY
# 1.    Write only those which is not in Python language (reserv words)
# 2.    Don't uses spaces in variables name, use underscore instead
# 3.    Don't start variable with capital letter, It's case sentative
# 4.    Always use short alphabates
# 5.    Don't use number in start of variable
# 6.    Variable should be meaningful
# 7.    Use global trend (eg df = datafram)
# 8.    Don't repeat same variable in code
# 9.    Don't use special characters
